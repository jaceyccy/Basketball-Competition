Prompt
The evolution of play style in the NBA was birthed out of necessity for efficiency. Using your data, optimize a facet of the game of basketball (player, team, or league based) for the better.
Project: Player Efficiency and Game Impact Analysis Goal
Identify that which statistics most strongly predict a player’s contribution to winning games
Research question
Which performance metrics most affect game outcomes?
Can we build a model to predict the probability of a team winning based on player stats
Methods:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): correlation heatmaps between features and win percentage
Feature selection + logistic regression/ random forest to predict win/loss
Visualization: player impact ranking, team comparisons
Deliverable
An interactive dashboard or visualization showing the top 10 players with the highest “win impact score”
